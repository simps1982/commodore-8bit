# Introducing PEEK and POKE
Few will ever have spent much time using an 8-bit Commodore, such as the C-64, without having encountered the **PEEK** and **POKE** commands.

These two BASIC commands respectively reveal the value stored at a specified memory address, and inject a value into a specified memory address. In other words, they are extremely powerful, giving the user direct unfettered access to the real workings of their 8-bit microcomputer. Accordingly, while many problems may be solved, and solutions achieved, most efficiently through correct use of PEEK and POKE, such fundamental commands do have the potential to compeletely freeze the computer, requiring a hard reboot, or to overwrite one's current program, erasing it from memory.

## Learning the POKE command
Probably the most common way for new users to begin to build familiarity with POKE on their Commodore is to simply change the colour of the fundamental elements of their display:
 - background colour;
 - border colour;
 - text color.
