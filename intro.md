# COMMODORE 8-BIT COMPUTERS WITH KERNAL [sic] and BASIC O.S.

This series of computers began with the famous Commodore **PET** (1977) and continued with the **VIC-20** (1980/81), **Commodore 64** (1982), and derivative models such as the **Plus 4**, **C-16**, and the final 8-bit models, the **C-128** and **C-128D** (both 1985).

By default these computers had not an operating system in the sense that many of today's younger users would understand, but a minimalist kernel (accidentally spelled Kernal by Commodore) approximately equivalent to a BIOS in an IBM PC, and the BASIC programming language interpreter. These both lived in a ROM chip for near-instant initial loading, and the user entered BASIC commands to carry out almost all day-to-day tasks as well as to optionally author their own programs.


## PROGRAMMING BEYOND BASIC

For advanced users who wished to code closer to the bare metal and achieve much faster execution times than the best efforts in BASIC could achieve for some types of program, there was the option of raw machine language coding - pure binary op-codes and memory addresses - which could be entered and executed at the BASIC prompt, or else there was an in-between option, the purchase of an assembly language software package which could be loaded from media such as cassette tape, floppy disk or cartridge. Assembly language for a particular microprocessor correlates very closely to the machine language; it is just a slightly more human readable expression of the op-codes (the actual electronic instructions that pass through the circuitry of the processor). Many assembler software packages bundled the assembler itself with an early form of an integrated development environment (IDE) - almost the VS Code of the early 1980s.
