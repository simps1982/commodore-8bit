# INTRODUCING COMMODORE 8-BIT COMPUTERS

This legendary series of computers began with the famous Commodore **PET** (1977) and continued with the **VIC-20** (1980/81), the all-time record-smashing **Commodore 64** a.k.a. **C64** (1982), lower-price-point derivative models such as the **Plus/4** and **C16** (both 1984), and the final 8-bit models, the more powerful **Commodore 128** (1985) and its two desktop-PC-form-factor variants the **C128D** (1985/86) and **C128DCR** (1986). The "CR" suffix stood for "cost reduced." From 1986 the classic "bread bin" case **C64** was phased out of production in favour of the higher profit margin variant the **C64C.**

Commodore's 8-bit microcomputers did not include as standard an operating system in quite the sense that many of today's younger users would understand, but a minimalist **kernel** (accidentally spelled **Kernal** and named just so by Commodore), approximately equivalent to the BIOS in an IBM-compatible PC, and the BASIC programming language interpreter. These both lived in a ROM chip for near-instant initial loading, and the user entered BASIC commands to carry out almost all day-to-day tasks as well as to optionally author their own programs.

By the standards of the time these microcomputers offered a quite generous amount of RAM available for end-user development, and were hugely expandable with a then unmatched range of plug-in upgrades and imaginative peripherals forming a huge computing ecosystem and helping to cement an unprecented ultra-loyal following. Early-modern operating system and productivity suite software packages with simple graphical user interfaces resembling those of their Apple Macintosh contemporaries were released by third-party developers for models such as the **C64** and **C128** although most users probably persisted with BASIC as their daily operating system, as the bestselling **C64** was not quite powerful enough to run such packages without serious compromises and limitations.

Much of Commodore's 8-bit range remains extremely popular to this day, either through the restoration of the original hardware, or through emulation packages on contemporary systems. The **C64** and **C128(D)** series models in particular are very popular, very well documented by their huge user-base, and strongly supported by emulators on most of today's major desktop platforms, aided by an extremely rich and diverse library of software.

## PROGRAMMING BEYOND BASIC

For advanced users who wished to code closer to the bare metal and achieve much faster execution times than the best efforts in BASIC could possibly achieve for some types of program, including graphical games, there was the option of raw machine language coding - pure binary **op-codes** and memory addresses - which could be entered and executed at the BASIC prompt, or else there was an intermediate option, the purchase of an assembly language software package which could be loaded from media such as cassette tape, floppy disk or cartridge. Assembly language for a particular microprocessor correlates very closely to the machine language; it is just a slightly more human readable expression of the op-codes (the actual electronic instructions that pass through the circuitry of the processor). Many assembler software packages bundled the assembler itself with an early form of an integrated development environment (IDE) - almost the VS Code of the early 1980s.
