# Commodore 8-bit Computing `(/commodore-8bit)`

This repository aims to be a small pool of helpful information about programming Commodore 8-bit microcomputers including the Commodore 64 ("C-64"), not only in BASIC, but also in raw machine code and assembly language. It also aims to show the relatonships between all three, and areas of overlap where improving one's knowledge of one language leads to an advantage in the others.

Small example programs, of a sort that might best be called demos or snippets, will gradually be added to the repository.
