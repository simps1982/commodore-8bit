# Commodore 8-bit Computing `(/commodore-8bit)`

This repository aims to be a small pool of helpful information about programming Commodore 8-bit microcomputers notably including the **Commodore 64 ("C64")** and **Commodore 128 ("C128")**, not only in BASIC, but also in raw machine code and assembly language. and in so doing, perhaps give those new to the scene a sense of why this computer platform seemed so accessible and inspirational and why it maintains such a devoted following today.

It also aims to show the relationships between the hardware design, BASIC, raw machine code, machine language monitor programs, assembly language and areas of overlap where improving one's knowledge of one topic leads to an advantage in the others.

Small example programs, of a sort that might best be called demos or snippets, will be added over time.
